## The Algorithm
The algorithm runs on Resnet-19, a machine learning framwoek from Pytorch. Specifically, it uses imagenet to classify images, having over 1000 objects that it can classify an image as. If the image that user uploads is detected as a type of squirrel, the user recieves a message alerting them that a squirrel has been spotted.
